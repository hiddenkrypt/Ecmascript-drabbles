# Template Files for JS Drabbles

After a few tries at some drabbles, I decided it would be good to have templates. This way I'd have a lot of the basic boilerplate out of the way, and I could spend my fifteen minutes just working on whatever thing I wanted to try and do.
Generally, the html file stayed the same for every drabble. The code.js file sometimes included lines I didn't need, so I'd adjust on the fly, but it still served as a very good starting point. 
drabbles.js includes two things: The browser compatibility shim for requestAnimationFrame(), and a 'key' object that binds useful names to keyCodes.
