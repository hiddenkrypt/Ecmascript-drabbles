# Ecmascript Drabbles

Just some randomly inspired Ecmascript experiments. These were done as a personal challenge, to implement new types of programs I hadn't done before, to learn more about HTML5 and canvas. I started with the idea of developing a given drabble under a strict time limit, but eventually gave up on that as I'd rather take as much time as needed to flesh some of these out and get them to a more finished state. 

Drabbles may use previous drabbles as a launch-point, either to create something new by modifying the code of the previous one (sploosh and fawoosh), or to expand the previous drabble further with new features (derfrun)

The drabbles started sometime in December, 2014. The earliest ones were lost, some overwritten by later drabbles that were meant to modify them, others due to terrible backup policy (thus why I'm keeping these on github).
