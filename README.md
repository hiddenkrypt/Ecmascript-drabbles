# Ecmascript Drabbles

Just some randomly inspired Ecmascript experiments. These were done as a personal challenge, to implement new types of programs I hadn't done before, to learn more about HTML5 and canvas, and to work under and extreme time limit and still put out something interesting. 

I started with a varying timelimit, but eventually settled on fifteen minutes as a hard limit. I allowed myself to fix any errors after the time limit, but only to get it back to something like the last good state before the time limit. That way if the timer went off halfway through a line I wasn't leaving behind a file that wouldn't even parse, but I had to leave any funky buggy behaviours that I hadn't solved yet.

Drabbles may use previous drabbles as a launch-point, either to create something new by modifying the code of the previous one (sploosh and fawoosh), or to expand the previous drabble further with new features (derfrun)

The drabbles started sometime in December, 2014. The earliest ones were lost, some overwritten by later drabbles that were meant to modify them, others due to terrible backup policy. 

I'm still writing drabbles here and there, but at the moment I'm trying to clean up the existing ones and move them to github. I'm still trying to recover many of them, so they're going to be committed here ina  patchwork sort of basis.
