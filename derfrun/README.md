# 6 - derfrun

An 'N' inspired platformer.
This is *not* the results of a single 15 minute block. I want to say this is a third or maybe fourth generation drabble, with the earlier forms lost. I do know that the first Derfrun was the basis for the template files, which is why it isn't a good match for them now. The templates changed after the first derf. 
Run, jump, wallgrind and kickjump. Occasionally derf.
