# 04 - Sploosh

A blind attempt at particle effects. I've never done a particle system before, but the mechanism seemed obvious to me. I actually got the basic effect down in the first few minutes, so I spent the remainder of my 15 minutes making it more generic. This turned out to be a good idea, as I then reused this code as the basis for drabble 05 - Fawoosh.
