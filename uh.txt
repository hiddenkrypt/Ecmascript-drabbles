light conversation, followed by minigame
A has to restore B's confidence to level 0. 
C doesn't help directly, she explains the game and mechanics. This is explained directly in a 4th wall breaking way.
Implicitly, it's because she wants A to take care of B. 
	--minigame appears--
	C: "quick, she's hitting rock bottom or something! Give her a hug and tell her she's pretty!"
	B: "Why am I the only one doing this? what are you doing?"
	C: "I'm giving you the tutorial, duh! Now, drop those blocks <game mechanics>"
